#INTEGERS

#In programming, an integer is a whole number. You can do all sorts of math on integers,
#just like you'd do with a calculator or in Excel or a database manager.

2+2

5*5

# In the command line Python interpreter, these results will always show up. 
# But if you run an entire Python (.py) program, however short, they won't. 
# To get results to actually appear, you need to "print" them to the screen.

print 2+2

print 100/5

# Order of operations works the same as real-world math you learned back in grade school

2+2*10

# ...is different than: 

(2+2)*10


# VARIABLES

# Instead of always using actual values, we can create a VARIABLE to hold it
# It's kind of like a nickname, but much more than that.
# It stores the value and let's us do things with it.

mynumber = 14

# Let's print to see what we get

print mynumber

# Once you have a variable, you can run math on it by using its name like you would the number
# Multiplication

print mynumber * 5

# Division

print mynumber / 2

# Addition

print mynumber + 20

# Subtraction

print mynumber - 5

# You can get as complex as you want with these...

print (mynumber*2+56)/100

# You can also create more than one variable

num1 = 100
num2 = 5
print num1*num2

# You can idenifty what TYPE your variable is like this 

type(mynumber)

# Are there other types? The answer - indeed!
# Let's find out in the next module... --->
